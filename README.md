# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

### This project is focused on mapping the earthquake data from the last 7 days.  I used data files pulled from the Earthquake USGS.Gov website along with Javascript and HTML to create Maps to display the key data.  

### The Map has 3 tile layer styles to chose from; Streets, Satellite and Dark.  The user can select which style they would like to view by hovering over the button in the top right corner of the map and clicking on their selection.

## Streets Layer

## Dark Layer

### The map can also be filtered to show 3 different layers.  Those layers are All Earthquake data for the last 7 days, Major Earthquake data and Tectonic Plate data.  All 3 are displayed by default but can be de-selected or selected using the same button in the top right corner of the map.  There is also a Legend included in the bottom right to show the color coding by magnitude.

### Each earthquake is displayed using a circle marker, with the size and color determined by the magnitude of the earthquake.  There is also a popup that displays for each earthquake when you click on the location.
